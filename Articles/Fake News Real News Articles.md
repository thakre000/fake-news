I feel very good. I did a show called Sasural Simar Ka for 6 years, 
and for 7 years that was the number one show. Kundali Bhagya, I am doing 
since past three and a half years, which is again the number one show. 
That's why I always joke that I am doing the number one show for the 
past 10 years. I am really happy and feel top of the world that people 
are loving me. Karan has become so big, the character and everything. 
I started giving my inputs to the character. 


I started playing in my way. People loved it. The brief was that he is 
a cricketer but when you give a personal touch to the character, it adds. 
Now, I can proudly say that there isn't much difference between Dheeraj 
and Karan. I was the captain of my school's cricket team. I was famous 
among girls because I was a good-looking champ. So, there's hardly any 
difference between Karan and Dheeraj. I don't act when I am playing 
Karan because it comes very naturally to me. Kundali Bhagya is doing 
great around the world and we are getting reviews. You speak about 
the American continent, the Gulf continent, everybody is loving it. 
We are loved in all the markets. I am fully enjoying the time right now.
